## About this place

While developing and doing minimal testing in this project,
[Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) VSCode extension has been used.

And in my VSCode settings I have this relative (to the root of this repo) path:

```json
"thunder-client.workspaceRelativePath": ".local",
```

Therefore, this place includes the data that this client (as alternative to Postman or Insomnia) uses.
